          Before software development, I've had the opportunity to explore many of my
          interests, including an educational background in engineering and political
          science and a professional background in education, writing, and law.

          Teaching has always been a rewarding experience, and watching my students grow
          continues to inspire me. I will forever remain a teacher and a studentâ€”nurturing
          to others and unafraid to ask questions. The challenges I have faced in law
          have taught me that a methodical approach will always yield a solution, so I will
          apply this to every challenge that comes my way. Through writing comedy, I discovered
          that there are always new, valid perspectives, and I will remain vigilantly open-minded.
          Ultimately, these are the principles by which I live and approach software development.

          I am passionate about political, educational, and judicial reforms. My free time
          is spent hiking with my dog, tampering as an amateur guitar luthier, reading, or
          exploring new foods in the area.
