              Before software development, I've had the opportunity to explore many of my interests,
              including an educational background in engineering and political science and a professional
              background in education, writing, and law.

              Teaching has always been a rewarding experience, and watching my students grow continues to inspire me.
              I will forever remain a teacher and a studentâ€”nurturing to others and unafraid to ask questions.
              The challenges I have faced in law have taught me that a methodical approach will always yield a solution,
              so I will apply this to every challenge that comes my way.
              Through writing comedy, I discovered that there are always new, valid perspectives,
              and I will remain vigilantly open-minded.
              Ultimately, these are the principles by which I live and approach software development.

              I am passionate about political, educational, and judicial reforms.
              My free time is spent hiking with my dog, tampering as an amateur guitar luthier,
              reading, or exploring new foods in the area.
